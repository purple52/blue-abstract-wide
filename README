The Blue-Abstract theme provides a clean, modern and elegant look for MythTV, a popular linux DVR software. All screens of the main application and major plugins have been themed. The screens from the plugins mythmovies, mythteatime and mythzoneminder are not included or unfinished. Currently the Blue-abstract theme contains the  most themed screens.

The theme contains a blue-abstract-wide menu which offers an improved menu structure.

To install the theme use the theme downloader feature from MythFrontend or copy the entire blue-abstract-wide folder to your theme directory. Example: /home/<user>/.mythtv/themes or /usr/share/mythtv/themes.
